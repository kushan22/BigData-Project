# Chicago Crime Data Analysis and Prediction

## Analysis

We have used various visualization tools like Bokeh, Tableau, Folium, Google Maps to analyse various crime trends that could 
help in the reduction and prevention of crimes in the city of Chicago.

This can be of great use to various Police departments in using our analytical results to take measures for stringent action in
ensuring the safety of the people of Chicago.

## Predictions

We have used Logistic Regression and Random Forest models to predict the primary type of crime from the data spanning 
over 20 years.
